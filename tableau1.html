							<p>SPACs experienced a dramatic increase in popularity throughout 2020 peaking in March of 2021. This can largely be attributed to the lower monetary and time commitment required compared to the traditional IPO process coupled with a surge in retail investor interest.</p>
							<p>Looking at our Tableau report we can quickly identify that although the number of priced SPACs vastly outpaced IPOs their collective market cap did not see similar outperformance. Adjusting our filters shows IPOs maintained a relatively even distribution across the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges compared to priced SPACs on the Nasdaq more than doubling that on the NYSE. This can broadly be linked to Nasdaq's skew towards growth and tech-focused companies as well as lower listing fees. In terms of location we see California dominates the IPO market with a similar story reflected in New York for SPACs.</p>
							<p>Regarding the construction of the report itself, I sourced the data from IHS Markit's Equity Deals Database. I selected a variety of quantitative and qualitative variables to build a wholistic set of views. I tend to modify default variable names on the dashboard for reader comprehension and naming consistency. When possible, I will use interactive charts rather than drop down filters to make my reports intuitive and to reduce visual clutter. Additionally, I like to include a list view of the source data at the bottom of my reports so that users can link directly to noteworthy records.</p>
